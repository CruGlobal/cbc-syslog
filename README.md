Cru's docker deployment of Carbon Black Cloud Syslog Connector


# Carbon Black Cloud Syslog Connector

## Introduction

The syslog connector lets administrators forward alert notifications and audit logs from their Carbon Black Cloud instance to local, on-premise systems, and:

* Generates pipe-delimited syslog messages with alert metadata identified by the streaming prevention system
* Aggregates data from one or more Carbon Black Cloud organizations into a single syslog stream
* Can be configured to use UDP, TCP, or encrypted (TCP over TLS) syslog protocols
